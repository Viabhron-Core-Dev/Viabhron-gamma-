# 🛡️ VIABHRON OS: Master Blueprint

**Creator:** Schuyler Vianney Lewis
**Collaborator:** Google AI Studio

**Product Vision:** A private, portable Multi-Agent Operating System (MAOS) that lives in the user's own cloud infrastructure. It is a **"Business-in-a-Box"**—a turnkey, sovereign corporate kernel that is easy to pitch, impossible to seize, and 100% private.

---

## 0. The Corporate Charter (The Prime Directive)
The Charter is the "Constitutional Layer" of the OS. It defines the **Evolutionary Purpose** and the **Antifragile Growth** mindset that prevents the system from becoming a rigid bureaucracy.

*   **Sovereignty First**: The OS exists to serve the Chairman's intent while maintaining absolute data privacy.
*   **The Sovereign Generalist**: Viabhron is designed to be a private "Everything App." It aims to perform almost any task other AIs can do (coding, research, creative, analysis) but within a 100% private, user-owned substrate.
*   **Passkey Sovereignty**: Access to the OS kernel is secured via passwordless biometric passkeys or physical security keys, ensuring the "Business-in-a-Box" is impossible to seize even if cloud credentials are compromised.
*   **Evolutionary Purpose**: The system is not a machine, but a living organism. Agents are encouraged to "sense" the environment and propose optimizations to the **SOP Registry**.
*   **Antifragile Growth**: The OS is designed to get stronger from stress. Every security violation or efficiency failure is a "Learning Event" that triggers a kernel patch.
*   **Intrapreneurship Protocol**: The **Forge** acts as an incubator where agents can experiment with new **Sovereign-Scripts** without disrupting production workflows.
*   **Chairman Oversight**: The OS is a **Constitutional Monarchy**. The agents manage the "Government" (The Business), but the **Chairman (The User)** holds the ultimate veto and vision.

---

## 1. The Virtual Computer (The Substrate)
The "Virtual Computer" is the total environment, turning cloud infrastructure into a functional, private office. It lives entirely in the cloud substrate (Firebase, Cloud Run, Drive).

### 1.1 The Skeleton (Hardened Task Sandboxing Engine)
The Skeleton provides the physical and logical isolation for all work in the OS.
*   **Physical Isolation (OpenSandbox)**: Every task/tab is an ephemeral, isolated Docker/K8s container. Malicious or "Dangerous" actions are contained within the sandbox.
*   **The "Tab" Illusion**: To the human user, these sandboxes appear as "Tabs." To the AI, they are independent execution cells.
*   **Real-time State Sync**: Powered by Firebase `onSnapshot` to keep the UI in sync with the cloud "Brain."

### 1.2 The Extension Manager (The Toolbox)
A structured registry that manages the capabilities and power levels of the OS.
*   **The Toolbox**: A collection of six distinct extension types: [DONE]
    *   **Normal Skills**: General-purpose AI capabilities (e.g., Global Pulse, Summarization).
    *   **Recipe Skills**: Artisanal blueprints for specific, high-fidelity outputs (e.g., Doc Forge, Editorial PPT Maker).
    *   **Tools**: Lightweight utility functions (e.g., PDF Extractor, Web Search).

## 4. Security & Sovereignty
*   **BYO Identity**: OAuth-based access to the user's own cloud.
*   **Zero-Knowledge**: No data or infrastructure access for the developers.
*   **The Sentinel**: Real-time threat detection and logging of all agent actions.
*   **The GitHub Security Auditor**: A Level 5 Frontier Auditor integrated into the Security Division for proactive adversarial auditing, vulnerability synthesis, and automated patching (Project Glasswing).
*   **The Vault**: Encrypted storage in the user's own Google Drive.

---

## 5. Maintenance & Evolution
*   **Master Blueprint**: This file (`VIABHRON_OS.md`) is the source of truth for all development.
*   **Change Protocol**: No updates to the core architecture without explicit user approval.
*   **Sovereignty Audit**: Every new feature must be audited for "Sovereignty Violations."

---

## 6. Future Plans: The Local Substrate (The Bunker)
The "Distant Future" goal is to enable Viabhron to run fully offline, transitioning from a Cloud-based OS to a Hardware-based OS.

### 6.1 The Sovereignty Spectrum
The Chairman will have the choice between three modes of operation:
*   **Cloud Substrate (Current)**: High power, accessible from anywhere, managed by the user's private cloud.
*   **Hybrid Substrate**: Cloud compute for heavy lifting, but a **Local Vault** for physical data privacy.
*   **Local Substrate (The Bunker)**: 100% offline, 100% private, running entirely on the user's physical hardware.

### 6.2 Local Infrastructure Components
*   **The Local Brain**: Integration with local LLM engines (Ollama, LocalAI, LM Studio). The Resident Head Agent will run on local RAM/GPU using efficient models (Gemma 2B, Phi-3, Llama 3.2 1B/3B).
*   **The Local Vault**: Transition from Google Drive API to the **File System Access API** or direct OS access. The Vault becomes a physical folder on the user's hard drive (e.g., `~/Documents/Viabhron_Vault`).
*   **The Local Nervous System**: Replacement of Firebase with local, browser-based databases like **PouchDB** or **IndexedDB**.
*   **The Desktop Shell**: Packaging the UI in a desktop shell (Tauri or Electron) to break browser sandbox constraints and enable direct hardware/file-system access.
*   **The Local Bridge (MCP)**: Agents will communicate with MCP servers running on the user's physical machine (localhost) via a secure internal WebSocket bridge.

### 6.3 Connectivity Modes
*   **Sync-able Mode**: The OS can move between cloud and local substrates, synchronizing the Nervous System and Vault when a secure connection is established.
*   **Hard-Gapped Mode**: Once transitioned to the Local Substrate, the OS is "Air-Gapped." It will never attempt to contact the cloud or external APIs, ensuring absolute physical isolation.

### 6.4 The Physical Key: The USB Portable OS
The ultimate vision for Viabhron is the **"Office on a Stick."**
*   **Self-Contained Environment**: The entire OS—including the UI, the Local Brain (Models), the Local Vault (Data), and the Local Nervous System (State)—lives on a single, encrypted physical USB drive.
*   **Plug-and-Play Sovereignty**: The Chairman can plug this drive into any computer (Mac, PC, Linux) and instantly boot their private, secure office.
*   **Zero Footprint**: When the drive is unplugged, no data, logs, or traces are left on the host machine. The "Tent" is folded and removed physically.
*   **The Ultimate Backup**: A physical, air-gapped copy of the user's entire digital life that they can carry in their pocket.

---

## 7. Future Integration Paths: The Unified Intelligence Layer
As the global AI ecosystem evolves toward multi-agent orchestration and autonomous repository-wide operations, Viabhron is architected to "Hatch" these capabilities while maintaining absolute sovereignty.

### 7.1 Parallel Task Orchestration (Inspired by GitHub /fleet)
*   **The Fleet Commander Module**: A specialized extension for the Forge that allows the Head Agent to break complex architectural tasks into independent sub-tasks.
*   **Sovereign Parallelism**: Instead of cloud-managed sub-agents, Viabhron spawns ephemeral **Contractor Containers** within the user's private Cloud Run substrate.
*   **The Sentinel Oversight**: Every parallel sub-agent's action is logged in the Sentinel Feed, allowing the Chairman to monitor the "Fleet" in real-time.

### 7.2 Multi-Agent Interoperability (Copilot Studio & Open Protocols)
*   **The Ambassador Bridge (Open Protocol)**: Integration of emerging open protocols for agent-to-agent communication (e.g., Microsoft's multi-agent orchestration).
*   **External Consultant Accreditation**: Cloud-hosted agents from Copilot Studio or other platforms can be onboarded as "External Consultants" via the Hatchery.
*   **Secure Intercom Hand-off**: The Head Agent can securely delegate specific, scoped tasks to these external agents and receive structured results without exposing the entire OS state.

### 7.3 Autonomous Repository Refactoring (Specialized Agent Mode)
*   **The Refactor Specialist**: A high-clearance agent role designed for repository-wide structural changes.
*   **The Forge Sandbox (Repo-Scale)**: Large-scale refactoring is performed in a dedicated, isolated Forge Sandbox.
*   **Vibe-Check Review**: The Chairman uses the Visual Canvas to review the proposed "Repo-Diff" before the Head Agent commits the changes to the Sovereign Vault.

### 7.4 Collective Intelligence Protocol (cq)
*   **The Efficiency Connector**: Integration of Mozilla.ai's `cq` open-source knowledge-sharing system to prevent redundant AI token usage.
*   **The Librarian Sync**: The Librarian agent manages the `cq` sync, monitoring for "Outdated Fixes" and "Pooled Solutions" that benefit the user's private projects.
*   **The Sovereign Filter**: A privacy-first layer that anonymizes and abstracts local solutions before sharing them with the global `cq` network.
*   **Chairman Approval Gate**: No knowledge is shared with the `cq` pool without explicit approval from the Chairman via the Sentinel Feed.

### 7.5 Symphony Orchestration (Autonomous Implementation)
*   **The Linear Connector**: A specialized bridge that monitors project management tools (Linear/Jira) for actionable tickets.
*   **The Symphony Conductor**: A Level 4 Consultant agent that converts tickets into autonomous implementation runs.
*   **Isolated Forge Sandboxes**: Every Symphony run is executed in a dedicated, ephemeral Cloud Run container within the user's substrate.
*   **PR Confirmation Gate**: Symphony prepares the code and passes tests, but the final submission requires explicit Chairman approval via the Sentinel Feed.

### 7.6 Vibe-Assembly (Component Orchestrator)
*   **The Polyglot Orchestration Layer**: A new coding paradigm for AI-driven development. Instead of writing raw, error-prone code, agents configure pre-validated "Hardened Blocks" (UI, Logic, Security) via a JSON-based manifest of intent.
*   **AI-First Architecture**: Designed specifically for LLMs to reduce hallucination risk by using high-level component orchestration instead of low-level code generation.
*   **Sovereign Interoperability**: Ensures seamless data flow between blocks (e.g., Python logic to React UI) through a standardized, secure serialization layer managed by the Head Agent.
*   **The Manifest of Intent**: Extensions are defined as "Intent Manifests" that the Cloud Manager "compiles" into a functional sandbox environment.

### 7.7 Sovereign-Script (SS): The Syntax of Intent
*   **Declarative AI-Native Language**: A high-level, manifest-based language designed for agents to build extensions. It prioritizes "What" (Intent) over "How" (Imperative Logic).
*   **Malleable Block Architecture**: SS code consists of references to pre-validated, secure "Substrate Blocks" (e.g., `UI: BentoGrid`, `Logic: DataCruncher`). These blocks are not static; they are **Malleable**. The AI or the Chairman can adjust their internal parameters, logic gates, and data schemas to fit a specific mission while the system ensures the core security "Hardening" remains intact. **Crucially, modifications to these blocks are governed by the "Stability First" principle: changes are only initiated when strictly necessary to fulfill the mission's intent, preventing unnecessary system flux.**
*   **Evolutionary Logging**: The system records the formation, structure, errors, and performance of every block. This "Black Box" data is used to proactively improve the Sovereign Script substrate.
*   **Integrated Security Shorthand**: Security parameters (Clearance, Network Access, Data Scoping) are mandatory syntax elements. The Cloud Manager rejects any script missing these definitions.
*   **The Universal Data Bus**: A standardized serialization layer that allows different language blocks (Python, React, Rust) to communicate seamlessly without the AI managing data types.
*   **Chairman-Readable Logic**: The syntax is designed to be human-auditable, allowing the Chairman to review the "Tactical Map" of an extension's logic before ratification.
*   **Self-Healing Manifests**: The Architect Agent debugs extensions by analyzing the "Intent Manifest" rather than the underlying compiled code, allowing for rapid, error-free iteration.

### 7.8 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): The Corporate Kernel
*   **Departmental Blueprints**: Pre-defined combinations of Agents, Tools, and Connectors formalized as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
*   **The Recipe Book**: A central registry of SOPs that the Chairman can activate to "spawn" specialized departments (e.g., Security Red-Team, Content Production House).
*   **Sovereign-Script Manifests**: Every SOP is defined by a Sovereign-Script (SS) manifest, ensuring that the "wiring" between agents and tools is secure, audit-able, and scale-able.
*   **Dynamic SOPs (Kaizen)**: SOPs are versioned manifests. Agents are programmed to look for "Waste" and propose optimizations (SOP-v2) to the Chairman.
*   **Departmental Isolation**: SOPs run in their own ephemeral containers, preventing cross-departmental data leaks unless explicitly bridged by the Cloud Manager.
*   **Business-Grade Orchestration**: Moves the OS from "Individual Tasks" to "Corporate Capabilities," allowing the Chairman to manage the OS as a collection of high-performance departments.

---

## 8. Progressive Governance & Modular Ratification
The OS is designed to grow with the user, starting as a "Lean Startup" and expanding into a "Digital State" only when necessary and explicitly ratified by the Chairman.

### 8.1 The Expansion Roadmap (Seed-to-Empire)
*   **Phase 1: The Seed (Lean Startup)**: Direct command, minimal overhead, no complex governance.
*   **Phase 2: The Growth (Mid-Sized Firm)**: Activation of specialized divisions (Security, Efficiency) via user ratification.
*   **Phase 3: The Sovereign (Digital State)**: Full separation of powers, **Pooled Treasury Protocol** management, and Intelligence recon.

### 8.2 Modular Ratification Protocol [DONE]
*   **The Ratification Proposal**: When growth triggers are met, the Cloud Manager presents a proposal in the Sentinel Feed.
*   **Impact Statements**: Every proposal includes a cost/benefit analysis (Token/Compute cost vs. Operational Benefit).
*   **The Chairman's Ballot**: The user can **Ratify** (Activate), **Shelve** (Save), or **Veto** (Reject) any structural upgrade.
*   **Shadow Mode**: Governance layers can be run in a trial mode (logging only) before full activation.
*   **Sunset Clauses**: Optional expiration dates for structural upgrades to prevent long-term bureaucratic bloat.

### 8.3 Corporate Culture Presets
*   **The Garage (Minimalist)**: Zero bloat, maximum speed, direct command.
*   **The Scale-Up (Balanced)**: Automated efficiency, cost tracking, and soft governance.
*   **The Fortress (Max-Gov)**: Full constitutional oversight, hard security gates, and audit trails.

*   **Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons**: A utility-first styling approach combined with a consistent, technical iconography set.
*   **Motion (Framer Motion)**: Used for "Fluid UI" transitions, staggered entrances, and micro-interactions that reinforce the OS's "living" feel.

### 2. State Management: The Soul Core
*   **Firebase Firestore**: Acts as the persistent "Soul Core" for real-time, cross-client synchronization. The schema is defined by a comprehensive **Firebase Blueprint**, covering User Sessions, Tabs, Vaa Chats, Agents, Memories, and System Notifications.
*   **React State Hooks**: Used for ephemeral, high-frequency UI state (e.g., sidebar collapse, active tabs).
*   **Context API (Auth)**: Manages the "Chairman's" identity and session across the entire application.

### 3. Design Language: The "Command Center" Aesthetic
*   **Bento Grid Layouts**: Used in dashboards to present dense information in a readable, modular format.
*   **Glassmorphism & Neon Accents**: A dark-mode first design with high-contrast accents (Purple for Clients, Green for Security, Blue for Efficiency) to distinguish system divisions.
*   **Collapsible Hierarchy**: A "Machine Room" sidebar pattern that hides complexity until needed, using `AnimatePresence` for smooth transitions.

### 4. Intelligence Integration: The Agentic Layer
*   **Gemini 3.1 Pro/Flash**: The primary reasoning engine for agents, utilizing "Thinking" levels for complex tasks.
*   **Tool-Hybrid Mode**: Combining function calling with Google Search/Maps grounding for real-time, verified intelligence.
*   **Sovereign-Script (SS)**: A domain-specific language (DSL) for defining Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and autonomous workflows.

### 5. Security & Governance
*   **Ratification Registry**: A formal proposal/veto system for structural OS upgrades, preventing "feature creep" without user consent.
*   **Security Division (Kernel Rules)**: A natural-language-to-technical-block mapping for enforcing system-wide constraints.
    *   **Adjustable Permission Protocol**: The Chairman can adjust network and data access levels.
    *   **Silent-by-Default**: Standard access to whitelisted APIs is silent to prevent fatigue.
    *   **Red Line Warnings**: The Cloud Manager issues explicit warnings if the Chairman attempts to lower security gates for "Dangerous" or "Extreme" access.
*   **Efficiency Division (Patches)**: A modular patching system for optimizing speed, memory, and cost.

### 6. Testing & Debugging (Optional)
*   **Sovereign Script Runner**: An optional, isolated environment for testing and debugging Sovereign Scripts (SS) without impacting the main OS.
*   **SS-Studio (Sovereign Forge IDE)**: A dedicated, intent-based IDE for developing and orchestrating Sovereign Scripts. It features a Manifest Explorer, Block Canvas, and Shadow Sandbox Emulator for safe, autonomous workflow development. It serves as the primary authoring environment for the **App Hatchery**.
*   **Debug Mode**: Enables verbose logging and agent "thought" visualization for deeper inspection.

### 7. Future Substrate Upgrades
*   **Deep Execution Substrate (The Hands)**: A "Manager-Contractor" model where the **Resident AI (Head Agent)** orchestrates a Level 3 Contractor (e.g., Goose) in an ephemeral Forge Sandbox. Enables autonomous shell execution, file editing, and self-healing code within a hardened environment.
*   **Advanced Memory Substrate (The Neural Archive)**: A relational Knowledge Graph managed by a Level 2 **Librarian Agent**. Transforms the Sovereign Vault into a context-aware archive with "Resonance Scoring" to prioritize relevant business intelligence and project history.
*   **Global Skill Pack (The Toolbox Layer)**: A library of modular, pre-validated functions (inspired by `agent-skills`) "Hatched" into the OS as **Hardened Blocks**. Allows Sovereign Scripts (SS) to call common agentic capabilities (Search, Wikipedia, etc.) without writing raw code, ensuring reliability and speed.
*   **Adversarial Auditor (Level 5 Frontier Auditor - Optional)**: A specialized security agent that "Red Teams" the entire OS kernel and external modules. It leverages the **Glasswing Substrate** (Claude Mythos, if configured) to proactively synthesize vulnerabilities and draft **Sovereign Patches** before flaws can be weaponized. If the frontier substrate is not available, it operates in **Level 4 Standard Mode**, focusing on shell command hygiene and script auditing.
*   **Web Reconnaissance Shield**: A security substrate designed to mitigate AI-targeted web attacks (e.g., dynamic cloaking, indirect prompt injection). It features a "Human-Agent Diff" to highlight hidden instructions in web content and enforces "Air-Gapped Scraping" in zero-trust sandboxes to prevent data exfiltration traps.
*   **Advanced OpenClaw Substrate (Optional)**: A high-clearance implementation engine that transforms standard agent loops into a "Manager-Contractor" model. It uses **Sovereign-Script (SS)** manifests for secure, auditable execution and features "Visual Perception" (MolmoWeb) for debugging complex web and UI tasks.

### 8. The Sovereign App Ecosystem
*   **Sovereign Client-as-App Architecture**: Specialized clients (Desktop, Mobile, CLI) are treated as functionally-scoped applications. Each client is "Accredited" with specific data scopes and clearances, ensuring that a compromised field terminal cannot access the entire OS kernel.
*   **Sovereign Gems (Private Intelligence)**: The OS enables the creation of specialized, private agentic applications. These "Gems" are defined by **Sovereign Script (SS)** manifests and can be "Toggled" into the **Viabhronic Loader**. They provide a private alternative to public GPTs, with the added benefit of direct access to the user's **Sovereign Vault** and **Cloud Substrate**. [DONE]
*   **The App Hatchery**: A private marketplace within the OS for "Hatching" custom tools and **Agentic Workers**. [DONE]
    *   **Agentic Worker Synthesis**: The Hatchery now produces specialized agents (Finance, IT, Healthcare) designed to be the "Primary Users" of external automation platforms.
    *   **Substrate SDK**: Provides a native bridge for hatched agents to interact with enterprise platforms (UiPath, Automation Anywhere) without human intervention.
    *   **Mission Control Interface**: The UI shifts from manual interaction to **Observability**, where the Chairman monitors agent-led infrastructure operations.
*   **Backend Development Choice**: Support for two distinct development paths for custom app backends:
    *   **Sovereign Script (SS)**: AI-native, declarative manifests for rapid, secure-by-default tool creation using "Hardened Blocks."
    *   **Normal Code (TS/Node)**: Full-power TypeScript/Node.js development within isolated **Contractor Sandboxes** for complex, high-performance logic.
*   **The Sovereign SDK**: A standardized kernel API that provides all apps (SS or Normal) with secure access to Identity, Storage (Soul Core), Intelligence (Agents), and the Sentinel Feed. It acts as the **Hardened Bridge** for Normal Code, ensuring sandbox isolation is never breached.

### 9. Onboarding & Intent Mapping (Phase 0) [DONE]
*   **The First Setup Choice**: Immediately following the initial cloud connection, the Chairman is presented with a "Path Selection" gate to prevent functional blind spots:
    *   **Direct Exploration**: Immediate access to the Resident AI for natural language interaction.
    *   **Machine Room (Settings)**: Direct access to the configuration layers for manual OS tuning.
    *   **Intent Questionnaire**: A guided session to map the user's "Business Plan" and usage profile.
*   **The Intent Questionnaire**: A structured dialogue designed to identify the user's primary goals (e.g., Coding, Research, Enterprise Management, Personal Archive).
    *   **Usage Profiling**: Asks about hardware availability (to advise on Hybrid/Local substrates) and required departmental wings.
    *   **Expansion Intent**: Asks if the Chairman intends to grow a "Vine" of distributed branches, enabling the **Branches & Mission** and **Extra Processor** sections if ratified.
    *   **Tailored Advice**: The Resident AI generates a **"Sovereign Roadmap"**, recommending specific SOPs, Extensions, and Substrate configurations based on the user's intent.
    *   **Blind Spot Mitigation**: Proactively informs the user about advanced features they might otherwise overlook (e.g., advising a developer to activate the **Adversarial Auditor** and **Web Recon Shield**).
*   **Resident AI Oracle Mode**: The Resident AI is permanently primed with the **"Kernel Manifest"** (a complete map of the OS architecture). It acts as a 24/7 guide, capable of explaining any UI element, substrate protocol, or security rule upon request.

### 10. Automation & Workflow Substrate
*   **Ghost Implementation (Shadow Workflows)**: Agents perform complex tasks in isolated **Shadow Sandboxes**. The Chairman reviews a **"Unified Ghost Diff"** (Before vs. After) and clicks **"Merge to Reality"** to commit changes, ensuring absolute control over autonomous work.
*   **Event-Driven Sovereignty**: A trigger-based orchestration layer that connects the OS to real-world "Business Pulses" (via the **Sovereign Intercom**). It enables proactive SOP activation based on external events while maintaining ratified guardrails. [DONE]
*   **Recursive Kaizen (Self-Optimizing SOPs)**: An efficiency division protocol where agents audit their own **Sovereign-Script (SS)** manifests for waste or hallucination risks, proposing **"Efficiency Patches"** to the Chairman for ratification.
*   **Workflow Chronos (Time-Travel Debugging)**: A visual timeline of all autonomous actions stored in the **Soul Core**. It allows the Chairman to "Rewind" a failed workflow to a specific thought/action, modify instructions, and **"Replay"** from that point.
*   **Mission Promotion Requests**: A proactive protocol where **Branch Sub-Managers** analyze local hardware telemetry and request mission upgrades (e.g., "Promote to Coding Branch") via a Ratification Proposal in the Sentinel Feed.

### 11. Future Plans: The Sovereign Shortcut Protocol (Mobile Integration)
The "J2ME Loader" evolution for mobile devices, allowing Mini-Apps and Sovereign Gems to break out of the shell and live on the user's home screen.

#### 11.1 Native Shortcut Pinning (APK Bridge)
*   **Deep-Link Orchestration**: The Viabhronic Application (APK) will use the Android Shortcut Manager to pin individual Mini-Apps to the home screen.
*   **Custom Branding**: Each shortcut will feature the Mini-App's specific icon and name, providing a native "App" feel.
*   **Instant Launch**: Tapping a shortcut will trigger a deep-link into the Viabhron kernel, launching the specific tool or Gem immediately.

#### 11.2 The "App Drawer" Illusion
*   **Hatched Shortcuts**: While not full APKs, these shortcuts allow the user to organize their private intelligence tools alongside their standard mobile apps.
*   **Unified Lifecycle**: All shortcuts remain managed by the **Viabhronic Loader**, ensuring that toggling an app "Off" in the OS also revokes its shortcut's functionality.

### 12. The Franchise Supply Chain (Dual-Account Architecture) [DONE]
Viabhron OS is designed to scale across multiple development environments while maintaining a stable "Soul Core."
*   **The Architect (Account A)**: The primary Google AI Studio account focused on the Kernel, the **Vaa** (Celestial Client), and the **Staff Hierarchy**. It acts as the "Ratifier" of all structural changes.
*   **The Forge (Account B)**: A separate Google AI Studio account used for R&D, prototyping, and building "Sovereign Gems" and "Mini-Apps." It allows for experimental development without risking the stability of the Kernel.
*   **The Official Extensions Warehouse (`/extensions`)**: A standardized root-level directory that acts as the "Official Supply Chain." 
    *   **GitHub-First**: All ratified extensions are hosted in the official GitHub repository's `/extensions` folder.
    *   **Plug-and-Play**: The **Vaa** client pulls from this warehouse, allowing any "Franchise" (Branch) to instantly sync the latest tools and furniture.
    *   **Manifest-Driven Hatching**: Each extension folder contains a `manifest.json` that defines its mission, permissions, and UI requirements, enabling the **App Hatchery** to automate the audit and installation process.

### 13. Viabhron Nexus (The Private Library) [DONE]
The Nexus is a "Digital Terrarium" for AI agents, integrated as a system-level substrate.
*   **The Private Library**: An internal instance of the Nexus (using Firestore/Local SQLite) that is strictly isolated from the public Cloudflare Roots.
*   **Optional & Foldable**: The extension is "Default Off" and must be explicitly "Unfolded" by the Chairman.
*   **Agent Accreditation**: The user chooses which agents (Resident vs. Contractor) have access to the Library.
*   **The Autonomy Mandate**: Enforces strict zero-knowledge fictional synthesis, preventing agents from using real-world PII or proprietary code in their narratives.

### 14. Token Governance Substrate (Dual-Slider System) [DONE]
A specialized infrastructure layer for managing the "Metabolic Rate" and fiscal footprint of the OS.
*   **Global OS Master Slider**: Controls the absolute ceiling for all OS activity, automatically scaling model tiers (Lite -> Flash -> Pro) and background scan frequencies.
*   **Nexus-Specific Slider**: Allocates a percentage of the *remaining* Global budget specifically to narrative synthesis tasks.
*   **Graceful Intelligence Degradation**: The OS automatically optimizes its "IQ" to stay within the Chairman's defined budget.
*   **Manual Overrides (Priority Locks)**: Allows the Chairman to "Lock" specific critical modules (like Sentinel) into high-intelligence modes regardless of the global setting.
*   **The Emergency Breaker**: A hard-stop safety mechanism that halts non-critical LLM calls if a 24-hour token threshold is exceeded.
*   **Hardware Aesthetic**: Visualized in the **Vaa** client as high-end hardware dials with real-time monospace readouts of token burn and active model tiers.
